Assignment Title: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Assignment Description: In this assignment, you will implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into multiple categories. You will use a dataset of your choice to train and evaluate your model. The assignment will involve data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Tasks:

Data Exploration and Selection:

Explore various image datasets available online.
Choose one dataset suitable for multi-class image classification. Consider datasets with diverse categories and sufficient number of images per category.
Data Preprocessing:

Download and preprocess the chosen dataset. Perform tasks such as resizing images, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model Building:

Implement a CNN model using TensorFlow or Keras.
Design the architecture of the CNN model including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Choose appropriate activation functions, dropout rates, and regularization techniques.
Training the Model:

Train your CNN model on the training dataset.
Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Monitor the training process and visualize training/validation loss and accuracy.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of your trained model on the test dataset.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance across different classes.
Results Interpretation:

Analyze the results of your CNN model.
Interpret the performance metrics and discuss any challenges encountered during the training and evaluation process.
Explore misclassified images and identify potential reasons for misclassifications.
Conclusion and Recommendations:

Summarize your findings and conclusions.
Provide recommendations for improving the performance of the CNN model or suggestions for future research.
